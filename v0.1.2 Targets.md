v0.1.1 Targets
==============
The main goal of v0.1.2 will be to "beautify" the UI. Some buttons will be added with no current functionality.
No core functionality will change to the game logic or gameplay for this update.

Functionality
=============
The UI will need to be altered as follows:
- Add in a File Menu that contains:
-   File - >New Game >Load Game >Save Game
-   Game - >Play >Quit
-   About
- Add in a button that will simulate the entirety of the game when pressed (to avoid individual turn stepping)
