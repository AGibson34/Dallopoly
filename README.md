Dallopoly
=========
Java-based Monopoly clone based on Dallas, TX.
This will be a Monopoly clone with a simple AI and no actual graphics engine.

Origin
======
This project was started in my CS 2336 Java Programming class. It started as a very rudimentary "game" that played itself after sending in a few player names. These players would take turns moving forward and backwards through an array of game board squares. Each square either took away money from the player, did nothing, or added money to their total. On the final square the game was ended and a check was made to see which player had the most money; that player was then declared the winner.

Project Goals
=============
Going forward I intend to allow the user to actually play a Monopoly like game. They will be able to purchase these "squares" and eventually put houses on them. Ideally I will make a rudimentary graphics system to display the board state; there is a possibility I do this with UTF-8 at first and then move to a graphical representation though for now the core gameplay mechanics and additional UI tweaking are the main goals. A save state will also be implemented as only the most bored of individuals could sit through an entire game of Monopoly ALONE!

Version History
===============
v0.1 -
--- From a class assignment ---
Game plays after two player names have been entered. The game is automated and simply displays a winner, based on amount of money held, when one player reaches the final square.
