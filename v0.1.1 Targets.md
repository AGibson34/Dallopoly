v0.1.1 Targets
==============
The main goal of v0.1.1 will be to add a button that allows the user to step through each player's turn individually.

Functionality
=============
The game will need to be altered as follows:
- Change the core gameplay from all turns being taken in a loop to be called by a button being pressed in the UI.
- Notify a player when it is their turn to press the "Take Turn" button.
- Show the player the result of their turn.
